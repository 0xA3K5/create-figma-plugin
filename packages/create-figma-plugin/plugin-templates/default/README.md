## Development guide

*This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).*

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v14
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing a JavaScript bundle for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

In the Figma desktop app:

1. Open a Figma document.
2. Go to `Plugins` → `Development` → `New Plugin…`.
3. Click the `Click to choose a manifest.json file` box, and select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build-figma-plugin` CLI.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console in the Figma desktop app, go to `Plugins` → `Development` → `Open Console`.

### Publishing to Figma Community

Learn how to [publish your plugin to Figma Community](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042293394-Publish-plugins-to-the-Figma-Community).

Figma will generate a unique plugin ID for you when you first try to publish your plugin. Copy and paste that ID into your plugin’s **`"figma-plugin"`** configuration (under [**`"id"`**](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/#id)), then rebuild the plugin to regenerate its `manifest.json` file.
