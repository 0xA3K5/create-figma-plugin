# `v1.0.0`

## `@create-figma-plugin/build`

- The `build-figma-plugin` CLI that ships with the `@create-figma-plugin/build` module is now powered by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), replacing Webpack. esbuild is *extremely* fast, and building any non-trivial plugin should reliably take **no more than 1 second**.

- Given the move away from Webpack, the ability to override the build process via a `figma-plugin.config.js` file has also been removed.

- Minification and type checking of your plugin code is now disabled by default in the `build-figma-plugin` CLI. The `build` and `watch` scripts in your `package.json` should be updated as follows:

    ```diff
      {
        ...
        "scripts": {
    -     "build": "build-figma-plugin",
    +     "build": "build-figma-plugin --typecheck --minify",
    -     "watch": "build-figma-plugin --watch",
    +     "watch": "build-figma-plugin --typecheck --watch",
          ...
        },
        ...
      }
    ```

- The ability to use SCSS in [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) has been removed. Now, only “vanilla” CSS Modules is supported. To migrate, [use the `sass` CLI to do a one-off conversion of your `.scss` files to `.css`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass), then update your UI code to reference the generated `.css` files.

- There’s now a [JSON schema](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/figma-plugin.json) for validating the plugin configuration in your `package.json` file. To enable autocomplete and inline validation of your plugin configuration in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), create a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing the following:

    ```json
    {
      "json.schemas": [
        {
          "fileMatch": [
            "package.json"
          ],
          "url": "https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/figma-plugin.json"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## `@create-figma-plugin/tsconfig`

- The [`tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/yuanqing/create-figma-plugin/blob/v1.0.0/packages/tsconfig/tsconfig.json) file that ships with `@create-figma-plugin/tsconfig` has changed significantly given the move to esbuild. Here’s the diff against `v0.0.84`:

    ```diff
      {
        "compilerOptions": {
    -     "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    +     "esModuleInterop": true,
    +     "isolatedModules": true,
          "jsx": "react",
          "jsxFactory": "h",
          "module": "ES2020",
          "moduleResolution": "Node",
    -     "target": "es2016"
    +     "lib": ["DOM", "ES2020"],
    +     "strict": true
        }
      }
    ```

- If you’re not extending from `@create-figma-plugin/tsconfig`, you should at least [ensure that the `"isolatedModules"` option is enabled in your project’s `tsconfig.json`](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript-caveats).

## `@create-figma-plugin/ui`

- There are *many* breaking changes and new features in `@create-figma-plugin/ui`. Your best bet for migrating to `v1.0.0` might be to try to build your plugin using the `build-figma-plugin --typecheck --watch` command, and then incrementally fixing the errors surfaced by the TypeScript compiler. Refer to usage examples of all the components in the [Storybook](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/ui/).

- One of the most significant changes is that the `onChange` prop of all components now has the signature `(event: JSX.TargetedEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void`. See the before and after:

    ```tsx
    // Before `v1.0.0`

    import { Checkbox } from '@create-figma-plugin/ui'
    // ...

    const [state, setState] = useState({ foo: false })
    return (
      <Checkbox name="foo" onChange={setState} value={state.foo}>
        Text
      </Checkbox>
    )
    ```

    ```tsx
    // `v1.0.0`

    import { Checkbox } from '@create-figma-plugin/ui'
    // ...

    const [value, setValue] = useState(false)
    function handleChange(event: JSX.TargetedEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
      const newValue = event.currentTarget.checked
      console.log(newValue) //=> either `true` or `false`
      setValue(newValue)
    }
    return (
      <Checkbox onChange={handleChange} value={value}>
        Text
      </Checkbox>
    )
    ```

- An alternative to writing native DOM event handlers in your code is to use the new `onValueChange` prop. This prop is available on all components that also have an `onChange` prop. The `onValueChange` handler has the signature `<Value, Name extends string>(newValue: Value, name?: Name) => void`, and it will be called on the DOM `change` event. The second `name` parameter passed to the handler is precisely the `name` prop that was set on the component. See the following example:

    ```tsx
    // ...
    import { Checkbox } from '@create-figma-plugin/ui'
    // ...

    const [value, setValue] = useState(false)
    function handleChange(newValue: boolean, name: undefined | string) {
      console.log(newValue) //=> either `true` or `false`
      console.log(name)     //=> 'foo'
      setValue(newValue)
    }
    return (
      <Checkbox name="foo" onValueChange={handleValueChange} value={value}>
        Text
      </Checkbox>
    )
    ```

- The `onChange` prop has been removed from the `SearchTextbox`, `Textbox`, `TextboxAutocomplete`, and `TextboxNumeric` components. (This prop was inaccurately named because it actually listens to the DOM `input` event.) Instead, use the `onInput` and `onValueInput` props to handle the DOM `input` event.

- The `DropdownMenu` component has been removed. Use the new `Dropdown` component, which has an improved UI design and component API.

- All component styles are now written as “vanilla” CSS modules rather than SCSS. The previous SCSS variables are now expressed as [CSS variables on `:root`](https://github.com/yuanqing/create-figma-plugin/blob/v1.0.0/packages/ui/src/css/base.css). Refer to the [`base.css`](https://github.com/yuanqing/create-figma-plugin/blob/v1.0.0/packages/ui/src/css/base.css) file in `@create-figma-plugin/ui` for the list of [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) that are available for use in your custom CSS.

- Added new components `Dropdown`, `MiddleAlign`, `TextboxMultiline` and `Toggle`, in addition to a comprehensive collection of **175** icon components derived from [Figma’s official “UI2” design system file on Figma Community](https://figma.com/community/file/928108847914589057).

### Detailed breakdown of component changes

#### Icons

- All icons are exported as Preact functional components. Refer to the following mapping to migrate existing icons to their equivalents in `v1.0.0`:

    - `checkCircleIcon` &rarr; `<IconCheckCircle32 />`
    - `checkIcon` &rarr; `<IconMenuCheckmarkChecked16 />`
    - `componentIcon` &rarr; `<IconLayerComponent16 />`
    - `crossIcon` &rarr; `<IconCross32 />`
    - `frameIcon` &rarr; `<IconLayerFrame16 />`
    - `imageIcon` &rarr; `<IconLayerImage16 />`
    - `moveDownIcon` &rarr; `<IconMoveDown16 />`
    - `moveRightIcon` &rarr; `<IconMoveRight16 />`
    - `searchIcon` &rarr; `<IconSearch32 />`
    - `spaceHorizontalIcon` &rarr; `<IconSpacingHorizontal16 />`
    - `spaceVerticalIcon` &rarr; `<IconSpacingVertical16 />`

    `IconCheckCircle32`, `IconCross32` and `IconSearch32` all have a dimension of `32px`, which is exactly double the size of the corresponding icons in versions of `@create-figma-plugin/ui` prior to `v1.0.0`.

## `@create-figma-plugin/utilities`

- `compareArrays` has been removed. Use `compareObjects` instead.
- `isWithinInstance` has been renamed to `isWithinInstanceNode`

- Added new utilities `compareStringArrays`, `getParentNode`, and `getSceneNodeById`.
